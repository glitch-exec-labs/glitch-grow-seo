# Changelog — `glitch-grow-public`

Auto-regenerated from `git log` by `/home/support/bin/changelog-regen`,
called before every push by `/home/support/bin/git-sync-all` (cron `*/15 * * * *`).

**Purpose:** traceability. If a push broke something, scan dates + short SHAs
here; then `git show <sha>` to see the diff, `git revert <sha>` to undo.

**Format:** UTC dates, newest first. Each entry: `time — subject (sha) — N files`.
Body text (if present) shown as indented sub-bullets.
